# R2-E - Research Robot (R2): Earth-class/Education

The name `R2-E` is inspired by two of the most famous robots on the screens: `R2-D2` and `WALL-E`.  In our project, the acronym has a different meaning: `R2` stands for Research Robot since it is a robot created for research; at the same time, the `E` signifies educational, while also evoking the essence of `WALL-E` as an earth-class robot.

Joining science and cinema together has great potential to make the world a better place. Movies have inspired different types of real-world robots, and a great screenplay is always funnier than a class.

Finally, our research is inspired by three pillars of `sustainability`: 1) reuse/recycling; 2) energy efficiency/green computing; and 3) educational inclusion. We transform existing devices such as Android TV SBCs and robotic vacuums into computational units and mobile robots; use them for our research on energy-efficient robotic software; and make it possible for public Brazilian schools to have access to this kind of technology through lectures about mobile robots and computer programming. Note that Brazil is a diverse and, at the same time, unbalanced country. Usually, public schools struggle to access modern technologies due to their limited budgets.
